Quick Installation (under 5 minutes) scripts for OpenStack Folsom.
-------------------------------

A quick installation guide for OpenStack Folsom for a single or dual node installation.

Prerequisites:
- The base minimum is one Server with 2 Network cards (one public and one internal card) running Ubuntu 12.04. Two servers are required if you want to run Compute (Nova) on a secondary server
- Run the scripts as root.
- Have a minimum of two drives (which uses LVM)
- It's recommended that you do this on a reinstalled test machine. It's against all possible recommendations to run these scripts on a production environment as it could potentially break/delete everything.
- It's recommended that you have a range of public/internal IPs so you can assign public IPs to your virtual machines.

Installation (as ROOT):
apt-get update
apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/speedis/openstackfolsom.git
cd openstackfolsom
chmod +x *.sh
./folsom01.sh
Follow the guide.

Uninstall:
To uninstall the whole installation (this will remove ALL trace of MySQL, Apache, RabbitMQ on the server etc so make sure you view and edit this file before running it!), run ./uninstall-folsom.sh
